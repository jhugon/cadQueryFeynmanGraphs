cadQueryFeynmanGraphs
=====================

Unlike what the package name implies, this package uses svgwrite to
create SVG feynman graphs that can be sent to the laser cutter
at Ponoko.  Just run feynmanGraphSVG.py to create a bunch.
Make sure the line width is set to the production value of 0.01mm

If vertexCircle doesn't work right, you probably don't have the
correct ends hooked up to the vertex.
